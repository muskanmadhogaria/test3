            <summary style="color: blue;">How likely is it that safe,effective vaccines for COVID-19 will be developed?</summary>
            <p><abbr>WHO</abbr> is cautiously optimistic that safe and effective
                vaccines for COVID-19 will be successfully developed. There is <i>a robust pipeline of
                    potential vaccines in development,
                </i>and some have already advanced to large (phase III) clinical trials based on promising early data.
           </p>
           <p>
            But for now, we can’t be certain if or when a COVID-19 vaccine will be available.
            That is why we must not rely on a future vaccine to fight 
            this pandemic – we must use all the tools we already have at our disposal, such as testing, contact tracing, physical distancing, and the use of masks.
